## Description

The contract is deployed on the Avalanche network using metamask and remix ide online. The "AkDegenToken" contract is a custom ERC-20 token designed to facilitate a token-based economy within a game or application. It allows for the minting, transferring, and burning of tokens, providing users with the ability to manage their token balances. The contract also features an item management system where the owner can add items with specific prices. Users can redeem these items by burning the appropriate amount of tokens, integrating a gamified experience where tokens serve as a currency for in-game assets. This setup enables a seamless and secure way to handle digital assets within the platform. To achieve this or to make your own token , u need to have the "ERC20.sol" contract installed or imported , which helps to build token with the predefined functions .
